## Build and Test

## About

LispX is a new Lisp I am developing to make web programming bearable.

It has three main parts:

* LispX's raison d'Ãªtre is to solve JavaScript's async problem.
  It does this with *delimited continuations*.
  It faithfully implements the
  link:https://okmij.org/ftp/continuations/implementations.html#delimcc-paper[delimcc API]
  as well as
  link:https://okmij.org/ftp//papers/DDBinding.pdf[delimited dynamic binding] 
  by Oleg et al. and can run the full link:test/delimcc-test.lispx[test suite]
  from the delimcc distribution.
  With continuations all async JS APIs (promise- and callback-based)
  can be used as if they were synchronous.
  
* As the language core, LispX uses John Shutt's
  link:https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/kernel.html[*vau calculus*].
  Vau calculus is essentially a lambda calculus without implicit evaluation
  of arguments (sometimes called "call-by-text").
  Vau calculus turns the usual programming/metaprogramming dichotomy on its head:
  metaprogramming is the default, and ordinary programming
  the boring special case.
  
* As the "user interface", LispX uses the good old syntax and nomenclature  
  of *classic Lisps* like Common and Emacs Lisp.  It is fully object oriented
  with single inheritance (`defclass`), has single dispatching generic functions
  (`defgeneric`, `defmethod`),
  the usual simple control forms (`catch`, `throw`, `block`, `return-from`,
  `unwind-protect`, `loop`, `dotimes`, `dolist`, ...), is a Lisp-2,
  and implements large parts of the CL condition system including restarts
  (`handler-bind`, `handler-case`, `restart-case`, `signal`, `error`, `invoke-restart`,
  `invoke-restart-interactively`, `compute-restarts`, ...).
  The condition system is of course written in LispX itself and is a good
  demonstration of LispX programming in practice: link:src/cond-sys.lispx[].
  
## Example

 (defun sleepsort (numbers)
   (dolist (n numbers)
     (coroutine (sleep n) (print n))))
     
## Implementation characteristics

* The implementation is about 2000 lines of JS and 1000 lines of Lisp
  (as measured by `cloc`).

* Clean and well-documented code.

* The build is *< 20 KB* (minified and gzipped).

* There are more than link:test[thousand unit tests].

* The architecture is a tree-walking interpreter so it's not a speed demon,
  but it's fast enough for many apps, especially GUIs.
  
* Readable Lisp stack traces.

* Easy to interface with JS.

* Works practically everywhere (browsers, Node, Deno, QuickJS, Duktape, ...)
  
## Code map (most important files)

* link:src/vm.mjs[] -- Core VM data structures like objects, classes, symbols, environments, etc.

* link:src/eval.mjs[] -- Evaluation of core forms like `def`, `vau`, `progn`, `if`, etc.

* link:src/control.mjs[] -- Evaluation of control-related forms.

* link:src/read.mjs[] -- Reader code.

* link:src/boot.lispx[] -- Language bootstrap. *This also documents all built-ins until I put together a reference manual.*

* link:src/cond-sys.lispx[] -- Condition system.

* link:src/js.lispx[] -- JS interface.

## Debugger example

 $ ./scripts/node-repl 
 Welcome to LispX!
 * (+ 100 x)
 Debugger invoked on condition:
 #<unbound-symbol-error :environment #<environment> :message "Unbound variable: x" :symbol x>
 Available restarts -- use (invoke-restart 'name ...) to invoke:
 continue
 use-value
 store-value
 abort
 Backtrace:
 x
 (#<function> 100 x)
 (%eval form environment)
 (eval (read) repl:+environment+)
 (#<function> (eval (read) repl:+environment+))
 (print (eval (read) repl:+environment+))
 [1] (invoke-restart 'use-value 42)
 142

## Language notes

### Strings

UTF-8.

### Numbers

Arbitrary-precision decimals.

### Booleans

`#t` and `#f` -- only booleans can be used with `if` etc.

Functions returning booleans end in `p`.

### Nil

`#nil` is only the empty list and _not_ a boolean, symbol, or marker for an absent value.

### Void

`#void` is used for absent values, e.g. returned by an empty `(progn)`.

### Options

We use options throughout instead of nil-punning.

An option is either nil or a one-element list.

Functions returning options end in `?`.

 (get? '(:bar 1 :foo 2) :quux)
 => ()
 (get? '(:bar 1 :foo 2) :foo)
 => (2)

Forms like `if-option` are used for destructuring:

 (if-option (value (get? '(:bar 1 :foo 2) :foo))
   value
   3)
 => 2

### Namespaces

There are three namespaces: variable (no particular read syntax), function (sharpsign quote), and class (sharpsign caret).

Unlike in CL, function (and class) symbols can also be used on the left-hand side of definitions and as parameters:

`(def #'foo (lambda ()))` has the same effect as `(defun foo ())`.

### Lisp-1/2

LispX combines the advantages of Lisp-1 and Lisp-2.

We can call functions received as arguments without the need for `funcall` by using
function symbols as parameters:

 (defun compose (#'f #'g)
   (lambda (x) (g (f x))))

If it's not a symbol, the operator position of a form is evaluated normally:
   
 ((compose (lambda (x) (+ 1 x)) (lambda (x (* 3 x))) 10)
 => 33

### Uniform compound definiends

The left hand side of definitions and parameter forms can be not only symbols
but also nested lists.  This provides a uniform solution for destructuring
and multiple values without any special forms such as `multiple-value-bind`.

 (def (x y) (list 1 2))
 x
 => 1
 y
 => 2
 
`#ignore` is used to ignore unneeded data:
 
 (let (((((#ignore . rest))) '(((1 2 3)))))
   rest)
 => (2 3)
 
If you think that `let` has too many parentheses, LispX might not be for you.
