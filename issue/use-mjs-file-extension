We should use the .mjs file extension instead of .js since the files
are ESM modules (pretty much: the import statements for .lispx files
are a Webpack extension).

However, if we use .mjs, then we can no longer easily use Webpack's
`global' thingy, which gives us cross-architecture (Node and browser)
access to global variables.  Presumably, this is because Webpack
treats .mjs differently from .js, even when the .js files contain ESM
export statements.

Deno supports `window', so maybe instead of `global' we could use that
for the browser and Deno, and have a special case for Node.
