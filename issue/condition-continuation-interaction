The interaction of conditions and continuations is not completely
satisfactory.  Specifically, when a continuation is reinstated, the
handler chains (of condition and restart handlers) are now the full
handler chains that were active when the continuation was captured.

This current solution is fine for use cases which are coroutine-like
but might be inadequate for more advanced uses of delimited
continuations.

To be fully satisfactory and aligned with delimited dynamic binding,
the handler chains captured by the delimited continuation should
supplement/extend the chains that are active when the continuation is
reinstated.  (As discussed in the DDB paper.)

The difficulty in implementing this proper solution this lies with the
condition firewall: when a condition handler is called, the condition
handler chain is temporarily rebound to the handler chain that was
active at the time the handler was installed with HANDLER-BIND.  The
interaction of this rebinding with handlers performing control effects
themselves, as well as the needed data structures for handler chain
supplementation are currently over my head.
