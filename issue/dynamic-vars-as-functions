Dynamic variables should probably be functions.

Then we could use (*standard-input*) instead of (dynamic *standard-input*).

Implementation strategy:
- vm.Dynamic becomes subclass of vm.Operator
  - has .value slot
  - calling with 0 arguments: return .value
  - calling with 1 argument: set .value
- Dynamics become wrapped
- PROGV unwraps and sets value
