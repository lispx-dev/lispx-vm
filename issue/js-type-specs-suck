Currently we use (Lisp) strings as type specs for JS objects (per typeof).

E.g. "string" means JS objects whose typeof is "string".  "null" is
special cased (since it's not a valid typeof result).

Maybe better: '(js-typeof "string") and 'js-null.

Maybe not use type specs for JS type errors at all - just have a
separate error class js-error?
